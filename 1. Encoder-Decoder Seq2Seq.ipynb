The class is structured to maintain a mapping of words to their respective indices and to keep a count of the frequency of each word's occurrence.\n","\n","Key elements of the `Vocab` class include:\n","1. **Initialization**: The constructor (`__init__`) sets up three dictionaries:\n","   - `word2index`: Maps words to their unique integer indices.\n","   - `word2count`: Stores the frequency count of each word.\n","   - `index2word`: Maps indices back to their corresponding words.\n","   Additionally, it initializes three special tokens:\n","   - `PAD` (index 0): Used for padding shorter sentences to a common length.\n","   - `SOS` (index 1): \"Start of Sentence\" token, often used in models to signal the beginning of a new sentence.\n","   - `EOS` (index 2): \"End of Sentence\" token, used to indicate the termination of a sentence.\n","\n","2. **Adding Words and Sentences**:\n","   - `add_sentence(sentence)`: This method takes a string input, splits it into individual words, and processes each word through the `add_word` method.\n","   - `add_word(word)`: This method checks if a word is already in the `word2index` dictionary. If it is not, the word is added to this dictionary with an incrementing index, added to the `index2word` dictionary with the corresponding index, and initialized in the `word2count` dictionary with a count of one. If the word is already known, only its count in `word2count` is incremented.\n","\n","3. **Utility and Tracking**:\n","   - The `n_words` attribute keeps track of the total number of unique words, starting from 3 to account for the three special tokens.\n","\n","This class facilitates the construction of a vocabulary from scratch, allowing for dynamic updates as new words are encountered. It is particularly useful in settings where the vocabulary needs to be expanded based on the input data, such as in machine learning models for language translation, text summarization, or other NLP

Explanation-\n","\n","1. Function Definition and Initial Setup\n","- **Function Initialization**: `get_dataloader(dataset, batch_size)` is designed to accept a dataset containing textual data and headlines, along with a batch size that dictates how many sequences each batch will contain.\n","- **Storage Arrays Creation**: Initializes two numpy arrays, `input_ids` and `target_ids`, with zeros. The arrays are sized based on the total number of entries (`n`) in the dataset and the predefined maximum lengths (`MAX_LENGTH_INPUT` for input texts and `MAX_LENGTH_TARGET` for target headlines). These arrays will hold the indexed representations of each sentence.\n","\n","2. Converting Sentences to Indexed Sequences\n","- **Processing Each Dataset Entry**: Iterates over each entry in the dataset. For each text and headline:\n","  - **Indexing**: Converts the text to a list of indices using `indexes_from_sentence(vocab, dataset.text.iloc[idx])` and does the same for the headline.\n","  - **Appending EOS Tokens**: Adds an EOS token to the end of each indexed list, indicating the end of the sequences. This is critical for models to understand where sequences end during prediction.\n","\n","3. Populating the Storage Arrays\n","- **Filling Arrays**: Each list of indexed words (including the EOS token) for the input texts and target headlines is used to populate corresponding rows in the `input_ids` and `target_ids` arrays. The sequences are left-padded with zeros to ensure that all sequences within a batch have the same length, which is necessary for processing in neural networks.\n","\n","4. Setting Up TensorDataset and DataLoader\n","- **TensorDataset Creation**: Transforms the populated `input_ids` and `target_ids` into PyTorch tensors and combines them into a `TensorDataset`. This dataset facilitates the pairing of each input sequence with its corresponding target sequence, crucial for supervised learning.\n","- **RandomSampler and DataLoader**: Incorporates a `RandomSampler` to shuffle the dataset entries thoroughly. This shuffling prevents the model from learning any biases or patterns from the sequence order in the dataset. The `DataLoader` is then set up with this `TensorDataset` and `RandomSampler`, and configured to yield data in batches of the specified `batch_size`.\n","\n","5. Return of DataLoader\n","- **Output**: Returns the fully configured `train_dataloader`, which is now ready to be used in the training loop of a sequence-to-sequence model. This DataLoader provides batches of indexed, padded, and shuffled sequences, ensuring efficient data handling and contributing to effective model training through improved data variability and computational optimization.\n","\n","This chronologically ordered description delineates each step involved in the data preparation process facilitated by the `get_dataloader` function, making it clear how it contributes to setting up data for efficient training in NLP models.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4a01VvRb2ltK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"gUkosX842ltL"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","One important aspect to note is that in this implementation, we are not utilizing pre-trained embeddings such as Word2Vec, which were discussed in Module 3 for handling sequential data.
